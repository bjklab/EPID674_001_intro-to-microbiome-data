# Course Goals

.pad-left[
- How do we measure the microbiome?

- How are microbiome data structured?

- What are the pitfalls and dangers of microbiome data analysis?

- What analytic methods and model frameworks help address those challenges?

- __Reproducibility and rigor in microbiome research (e.g., reproducible reports)__

# How to measure the microbiome?

# "The Microbiome"

.pad-left[

- Loose: “the microorganisms in a particular environment” (synonymous with “microbiota”)
  
- Strict: “the combined genetic material of the microorganisms in a particular environment”

    - emphasis on nucleic acid sequencing 
    
    - “omics” often defined by the tools on which they depend

]


---

# Biology/Ecology + Technology

.pad-left[
- Biology/Ecology:

    - previously undetected microbial species
    
    - previously unappreciated inter-taxa interactions
    
    - clinical relevance of these species and interactions

- Technology:

    - __not__ “unbiased” surveys of microbial communities
    
    - sequencing error, wet and dry lab decisions...

]



---

# Wet Lab Decisions

.pad-left[
- Specimen acquisition:

    - what is being sampled?
    
    - how are samples obtained and processed? (e.g., cell-associated bacteria from BAL; difficult-to-lyse Mycobacteria or spores)

- Sequencing library preparation:

    - choose amplicon?
    
    - choose metagenomic?

]


---

# Dry Lab Decisions

.pad-left[

- Sequence modality: short reads versus long reads?

- Barcodes and de-multiplexing: Golay codes -- how much error is too much error?

- Paired-end joining: how much overlap and how much error?

- Sequence clustering:

    - amplicon: operational taxonomic units or sequence variants?
    
    - metagenomic: choice of assignment tool?

]


---

# More data... more problems

.pad-left[

- Measurement methods and tools differ.

- Data embed wet and dry lab choices.

- __BUT__ data structures similar and create common concerns:

    - sparse count data
    
    - misclassification risks
    
    - high-dimensional data (p >> n)

# Microbiome Data Structure

.pad-left[
- Sparse count data generated by sequence binning/assignment.

- Typically 1e2 - 1e4 microbiome variables (exceed observations).

- Cross-sectional or time-series measures.

- __Generative model for observed microbiota / genes / metabolites.__

- __Measurement model that accounts for constraints of tools we use.__

# Pitfalls and dangers... 



---

# How do microbiome studies go wrong?

.pad-left[
- What is adequate sampling to estimate composition? ("shallow shotgun")

- How are microbes shared across study participants? ("cage effects")

- How to link sequence data to extant knowledge? (binning ITS data) 

- Absolute abundance versus relative abundance? (Gloor et al)

- How to discriminate sub-species community members? ("strain-level")

# Microbiome Methods in Common Use

.pad-left[
- Summary statistics (alpha diversity)

- Distance metrics (beta diversity)

- Mixture models (Dirichlet multinomial mixtures) 

- Non-parametric tests (PERMANOVA/adonis)

- Data transformations (centered log-ratio transform)
